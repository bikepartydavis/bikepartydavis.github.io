## Bike Party Davis

Bike Party Davis is a monthly ride which is built to be radically inclusive and invite people from all walks together for a short and friendly paced bicycle ride. 

We journey toegther for about an hour of riding, not including a short stop at a local park, highlighting a different part of Davis' wonderful bicycle infrastructure with each ride. 

Riders are encouraged to come in costume and to bring the party, we do however ask that you do such safely and in adhenrence of relevant laws.
